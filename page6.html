                        The Sims 4 is a social simulation game developed by Maxis and published by Electronic Arts.
                        Like previous titles in the series, The Sims 4 allows players to create and dress characters called "Sims", build and furnish houses for them, and simulate their everyday lives. 
                        <li>The game introduces a newly developed custom game engine, with improved character creation and housebuilding tools, as well as deeper in-game simulation with the new emotion and personality systems for Sims. </li>

                    <li> 
                        The Sims 4 is a social simulation game in the same vein as the previous releases in the series. There is no core purpose or goal to attain, and the player is encouraged to make choices and actively engage in an interactive environment rather than achieving objectives. 
                        <li> The game's focus is on the simulated lives of virtual individuals known as "Sims," and the user is in charge of controlling their behaviours, responding to their "needs," and assisting them in achieving their aspirations. Though not required, objective-based gaming is accessible if desired, with each Sim having lifelong ambitions and "wants and fears" personal objectives developed depending on current activity. </li>
                      
                        <li>Simoleons ($) are the game's currency, and Sims speak in a fictitious language called Simlish. Sims have six needs: food, bladder, hygiene, sociability, fun, and energy, which are depleted as the Sim moves through an in-game day and are replenished by different household objects and furnishings. Sims earn money mostly by working or selling handmade products such as paintings and garden produce, and Sims must learn skills in order to work and craft items; for example, Sims in the Culinary career track must be adept in Cooking skill. The game has a long list of hacks, such as endless money and secret gameplay options. </li>
